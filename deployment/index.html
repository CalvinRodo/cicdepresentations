					<section>Pretty much just copying some files to a server.</section>
					<section>Thank You have a nice day.</section>

					<section>Recreate</section>
					<section>Probably what 99% of you are doing right now.</section>
					<section>
						Pros:
						Easy to setup.
						Application state entirely renewed.
						Cons:
						High impact on the user, expect downtime that depends on both shutdown and boot duration of the application.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>Blue/Green</section>
					<section>Pros:

Instant rollout/rollback.
Avoid versioning issue, the entire application state is changed in one go.
Cons:

Expensive as it requires double the resources.
Proper test of the entire platform should be done before releasing to production.
Handling stateful applications can be hard.</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>Canary</section>
					<section>
					Pros:

Version released for a subset of users.
Convenient for error rate and performance monitoring.
Fast rollback.
Con:

Slow rollout.

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>Ramped</section>
					<section>
						Pros:

Easy to set up.
Version is slowly released across instances.
Convenient for stateful applications that can handle rebalancing of the data.

Cons:
Rollout/rollback can take time.
Supporting multiple APIs is hard.
No control over traffic.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>Shadow</section>
					<section>
						Pros:

Performance testing of the application with production traffic.
No impact on the user.
No rollout until the stability and performance of the application meet the requirements.
Cons:

Expensive as it requires double the resources.
Not a true user test and can be misleading.
Complex to setup.
Requires mocking service for certain cases.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>Special Mention</section>
					<section>A/B Testing</section>
					<section>
						Pros:

						Several versions run in parallel.
						Full control over the traffic distribution.
						Cons:

						Requires intelligent load balancer.
						Hard to troubleshoot errors for a given session, distributed tracing becomes mandatory.
